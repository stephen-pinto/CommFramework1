# EasyRpc
This library is a simple RPC library which provides the basic infrastructure for simple RPC usecases and will help achieve communication between applications in different technology like C#, C++ and other such technologies supported by gRPC and JavaScript for Browser and Node (ones supported by SignalR).
SignalR is acting like a plugin in this RPC library which will allow us to integrate to the channel using signalr benefiting from its failover mechanisms and browser compatibility.
